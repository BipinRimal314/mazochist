/**
 * Procedural sound. No assets, everything is an oscillator or a noise buffer.
 *
 * The context is created lazily and resumed on demand — browsers start it
 * suspended until a gesture — and every call is wrapped, because audio is never
 * worth crashing a frame over.
 *
 * Three things here are not decoration:
 *
 * **Footfalls carry the ground.** Sand and snow already change the physics, so
 * making them change the footstep teaches the mechanic with nothing written
 * down — you hear the drag before you have finished wondering why the corner
 * came up wrong. It is the same doctrine as the rest of the game: explain with
 * consequence, not with a caption.
 *
 * **The ghost is audible before it is visible.** A drone that rises as it
 * closes gives you the one thing a countdown cannot: which direction to run.
 *
 * **Each terrain has its own air.** A bed per chapter, so the journey sounds
 * like it is going somewhere as well as looking like it.
 *
 * The one-shots are fire-and-forget. The three above are a small persistent
 * graph, torn down whenever a level unmounts — `stopAmbience` is not optional
 * housekeeping, a leaked oscillator plays forever.
