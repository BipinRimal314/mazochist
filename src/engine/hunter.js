/**
 * The hunter: the fourth and last mechanic.
 *
 * The rule, in full:
 *
 *   Take too long and something starts looking for you. It always knows where
 *   you are. It is slower than you. Touching it sends you back to the start.
 *   Returning to the start — for any reason — puts it back to sleep.
 *
 * That last clause is what keeps it from being the mechanic that broke the
 * previous game. A chaser that persists across a respawn can camp the start and
 * kill you the instant you appear, which is not difficulty, it is a soft lock.
 * Sleeping on every return to the start also means the hunter's clock and the
 * player's "current attempt" are the same clock, so the thing the player has to
 * reason about is exactly the thing they can see.
 *
 * Two invariants make it fair, and both are tested rather than argued:
 *
 * 1. **It cannot catch you through a wall.** It walks the same graph the ball
 *    does, and a catch additionally requires the two cells to be the same or
 *    joined by an open edge. Proximity alone is not enough — two cells either
 *    side of a wall can put the centres well inside the catch distance.
 *
 * 2. **It is strictly slower than the ball.** The cap is checked against the
 *    ball's real terminal velocity, not its `MAX_SPEED` constant — friction
 *    means the ball never actually reaches `MAX_SPEED`, and sizing the hunter
 *    against a number it cannot reach would make it faster than the player it
 *    is chasing.
 *
 *    It is also sized against the **slowest ground on that particular grid**,
 *    not against the ball at full tilt. Deep snow costs the ball nearly a third
 *    of its top speed; a hunter allowed two thirds of the *unslowed* ball would
 *    be faster than a player wading through it, and being caught now costs the
 *    whole level. The cap is per-grid for exactly that reason.
 *
 * It never gates correctness. `spawnMs` is derived per level from how long a
 * perfect player actually takes (see `generate.js`), so a player walking the
 * optimal route never meets it at all. The oracle then re-judges the level with
 * the hunter present and still demands zero deaths from perfect play, so the
 * claim is checked and not merely intended.
