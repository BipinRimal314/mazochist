/**
 * Game state and one fixed step of simulation.
 *
 * The complete rule set:
 *
 *   - Capture every flag. Capturing one sends you back to the start.
 *   - Traps are invisible. Stepping on one sends you back to the start and
 *     counts as a death.
 *   - Once every flag is captured, reach the exit.
 *   - Fog, where a level has it, shows only what is near you. Cells you have
 *     stood in stay dimly remembered.
 *   - The hunter, where a level has one, wakes after a while and comes for you.
 *     It is slower than you. **Touching it loses the level outright.** Returning
 *     to the start puts it back to sleep.
 *
 * The two failure modes are deliberately not the same weight. A trap costs you
 * the walk back and nothing else — your maize is safe, always. The hunter costs
 * you the level. That is the only thing in the game that can take picked maize
 * away, and it is the reason the countdown is worth watching.
 *
 * There is nothing else. No eras, no death modes, no escalation that changes
 * the rules while you play. Every bug in the last version came from those:
 * escalation that made levels unwinnable after ten deaths, a death mode that
 * wiped flags you could only reach by dying, a mechanic switched on by era that
 * contradicted another mechanic switched on by era.
 *
 * Captured flags persist across deaths, always. That single rule removes the
 * entire class of "you must die to progress but dying undoes progress".
 *
 * Plain mutable state, no React. The component reads a small snapshot a few
 * times a second and is otherwise not involved.
