 * Two things here are load-bearing rather than decorative:

 * `ballDrawMetrics` keeps the ball's ink inside its collision radius. The
 * physics clamps the centre to exactly one radius from a wall, so a rim stroked
 * *on* that radius puts half its width into the wall and the ball looks like it
 * is clipping through when the collision is exact to 1e-9. It is a function so a
 * test can assert the relationship instead of someone eyeballing a screenshot.
 *
 * Walls are drawn thin and without a downward shadow offset for the same
 * reason: ink that leans into the player's cell reads as penetration.

 *
 * Every ground here is dark and every wall emits light. That is not a mood

 *
 * The Lit Wood was drawn this way first and was, by a distance, the only board
 * in the game that looked designed. This is that chapter's principle taken
 * everywhere, with a hue per terrain so the journey still visibly moves.
 *
 * The start, the exit, the maize and the ball keep their own colours on every
 * terrain — those four are how the player reads the board, and re-tinting them
 * per chapter would re-teach the vocabulary every time the scenery changed.
