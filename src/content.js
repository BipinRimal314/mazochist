/**
 * Every word the player reads. This is the file to edit.
 *
 * All of the writing lives here so that changing a line never means opening
 * anything that has behaviour in it. Nothing in this file does anything — it is
 * data, imported by the engine for the in-level lines and by the story layer
 * for the cards between levels.
 *
 * WHAT IS WHERE
 *
 *   PROLOGUE, CHAPTER_BEATS, BARGAIN,     the story cards, in the order they
 *   TOO_LATE, SPEEDRUN_BRIEF, ENDING,     are shown
 *   LOST_HER
 *
 *   WHISPERS                              fragments heard mid-level, keyed by
 *                                         level name
 *
 *   DEATH_QUIPS, CAUGHT_QUIPS             what the farmer says when it goes
 *                                         wrong
 *
 *   PICKED_ONE, PICKED_LAST, GHOST_WOKE   the other in-level lines
 *
 * TWO VOICES
 *
 *   n('...')  the farmer. Present tense, flat, and consistently not finishing
 *             the sentence that matters.
 *   v('...')  the voices — overheard, remembered, or not really there. They say
 *             the part he skips.
 *
 * The reveal happens in the gap between them, so if you add a line, it belongs
 * to one of those two and not to a narrator explaining things.
 *
 * The only player-facing text NOT in here is the chapter names and blurbs,
 * which live in `src/scripts/buildLevels.js` because they are baked into
 * `levels.json` when the campaign is generated. Change one of those and run
 * `npm run levels` to see it.
