/**
 * Difficulty tiers. Only a handful of numbers vary, which is the point: there
 * is no combination of mechanics to get wrong because there are only four
 * mechanics, and each tier turns on at most one of them that the tier before
 * did not have.
 *
 * Boards are landscape, not square, because the screen is: a square maze on a
 * wide window is a postage stamp with a margin either side of it. Cell counts
 * are held roughly constant across the change so the tiers stay as hard as they
 * were — 14x14 became 18x11, which is 196 cells against 198.
 *
 * The fog only ever tightens, and only on a chapter that is not introducing
 * something else: 4.5 where it arrives, 2.9 from the chapter that is about fog,
 * 2.4 once the boards get bigger. The chapters that introduce the hunter and
 * fading memory inherit the radius of the one before them untouched, because
 * one new variable at a time is the whole reason a player can tell what got
 * harder.
 *
 * `hunter` is `{ speed, margin }` or absent. `speed` is cells per simulation
 * step, clamped by `HUNTER_SPEED_CAP` so it can never out-run the ball.
 * `margin` is how much slack a perfect player gets: the hunter's timer is set
 * to the longest trip perfect play actually takes, times this. 1.7 means you
 * can be seventy percent slower than optimal before anything comes looking.

 * physics simulation, so a candidate with the wrong shape is thrown away for
 * almost nothing — only the ones that ask the right question are expensive.
 *
 * The thresholds are taken from the measured spread of the thirty-nine levels
 * that already exist, not invented: `warren` wants a junction rate above the
