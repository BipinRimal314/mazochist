/**
 * The oracle: everything a level must satisfy before it is allowed to exist.
 *
 * A level is generated, then judged. If it fails any check it is thrown away
 * and the next seed is tried. Nothing is ever patched up to pass — a level that
 * needs fixing is a level we do not need.
 *
 * The checks are ordered cheapest first, because most rejections are cheap
 * ones and the physics simulation is by far the most expensive.
 *
 * Each rule below exists because its absence shipped a broken level last time.
