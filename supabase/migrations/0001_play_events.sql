-- Playtest telemetry.
--
-- One row per thing a tester did with a level. The point is to answer the
-- questions a playtest is actually for: which level did people quit on, how
-- many deaths did a level really cost, did anyone reach the end.
--
-- Two deliberate constraints on what goes in here:
--
--   * Nothing identifying. `player_id` is a random uuid minted in the browser
--     and kept in localStorage. There is no name, no email, no IP column, no
--     free text. A tester who clears their storage becomes a new player, and
--     that is the correct trade for not holding anything about them.
--
--   * The browser can only ever INSERT. The anon key ships inside a public
--     page, so it must be assumed hostile: RLS below grants insert and nothing
--     else, so a reader of the page cannot pull back other testers' rows.
